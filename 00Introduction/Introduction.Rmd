# Statistical Value Chain

## Value Chains

### Porter's value chain (1985)

_The idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs._


## Statistical Value Chain

### Notes

- This part only pertains to the data processing stage. Collection, design,
dissemination is not included.
- The fixed points are well-defined statistical products.


## Stages in the SVC

1. **Raw Data** is data as it arrives
    - Can differ in quality/source: survey/admin/big data
2. **Input data** satisfies technical demands:
    - File type is known and can be read
    - Variables are of correct type (number/date/text/categorical$...$)
    - Records identified with statistical objects
    - Variables identified with statistical properties


## Stages in the SVC

3. **Valid data** satisfies domain knowledge constraints
    - Age cannot be negative
    - Someone under 15 yrs old cannot have income from work
    - mean economic growth/decline does not exceed 5\% in a certain sector
    - $...$
    
### Justification

Invalid data leads to invalid statistical results.


## Stages in the SVC

4. **Statistics** are the target output values (aggregates) describing the population
characteristic of interest.
    - Economic growth
    - Unemployment
    - Income distribution
    - GDP
    - $\ldots$

### Note

Statistics also need to satisfy domain knowledge constraints.


## Stages in the SVC

5. **Output** are statistics, formatted and annotated for publication
    - Figures, tables
    - Definitions
    - $..$


## The SVC: Remarks

- Actual data processing is not necessarily linear across the chain
- In production architectures a more flexible model is often used where
the definition of interfaces between processing steps play a crucial role.
The chain shown here is a general example covering most steps in some way.
- The general idea scales really well.
